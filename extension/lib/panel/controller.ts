// The side panel's controller: connects the pure state machine (reducer.ts) to the outside world.
// It owns every side effect of the panel: reading and saving the draft, listening for captures,
// running a check, cancelling, sending feedback, and opening the website.
//
// Two safety properties live here:
//   - the saved draft is never overwritten by the empty initial state: saving is switched on only
//     after the restore step has finished;
//   - a check is started exactly once per "submit": the reducer only sets `submitting` for a valid
//     draft in the Review view and gives that submit a new run id, and a run is started only for
//     a run id that has not started yet. A run is "stale" once a newer run, a cancel, or a new
//     capture has taken over (or the panel closed); a stale run stops and its late answers are
//     ignored, so a slow first check can never block or overwrite what the buyer does next.
