// The side panel's state machine, as a pure reducer.
//
// Views: idle (nothing captured), capturing, review, checking, result, failure.
// Rules this file guarantees (each pinned by a test):
//   - a capture job is applied once: a job that was already applied, or is older than one that
//     was, is ignored, so reopening the panel can never overwrite the buyer's newer edits; and a
//     draft restored from storage never overwrites a capture that arrived while it was loading;
//   - the buyer's draft survives failures, cancels, and seller-page additions;
//   - "submit_requested" is a no-op unless the Review view is showing, nothing is running, and the
//     draft is valid, so pressing the button twice cannot start two checks.
// Side effects (storage, network, timers) live in controller.ts; this file has none.
