// Runs one check from "Check listing" to a result: prepare the photos, submit ONCE, then follow
// the five processing stages until the result is ready.
//
// All side effects (the API client, photo preparation, waiting, and the progress callbacks) are
// passed in as `deps`, so this logic is tested with fakes and no real timers.
//
// Behaviour worth knowing:
//   - if no photo can be prepared nothing is submitted;
//   - the buyer is told once, after SLOW_AFTER_MS, that the check is taking longer than usual
//     (no percentages and no fake progress);
//   - polling stops when the run is dropped (the buyer cancels, or opens another listing) and the
//     server is told to stop that check, so nobody is left with a check they never saw; it also
//     gives up after GIVE_UP_AFTER_MS, so a stuck server can never leave the panel spinning;
//   - a status request that never reached the server is tried again a few times, because the
//     server keeps scoring and one dropped request must not end the check.
