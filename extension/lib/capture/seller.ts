// Reads seller details from a seller / profile page, using the SAME conventions the models were
// trained on.
//
// Why conventions matter: the behavioural model was trained on seller fields that the Data
// Collector extracted with an LLM under fixed rules (Collector: extraction_contract.py). The
// extension has no LLM, so these deterministic parsers must reproduce those rules or the model
// would see inputs unlike its training data:
//   - account age (days): a stated duration is 1 year = 365 days and 1 month = 30 days; a stated
//     join date is the number of days from that date to today;
//   - "No reviews yet": review count 0, and rating 0.0 when no rating is shown;
//   - active listings: the "N AVAILABLE ADS" figure when the page states one (Mudah); otherwise
//     the listing cards NOT marked SOLD. A "Listings" heading with no cards is 0; no heading and
//     no cards is "not found" (null), never 0. Mudah shows no ratings, so rating and review count
//     stay "not found" there rather than 0.
//
// The exact wording on the real pages comes from docs/SPIKE_NOTES.md ("Seller page phrases").
// When a real page uses wording these patterns miss, add the pattern here AND a test for that
// wording in seller.test.ts, and keep the comments above accurate.
