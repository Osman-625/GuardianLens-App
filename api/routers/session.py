"""Session endpoints for clients that cannot rely on the website's cookie.

The browser extension has its own origin, so it keeps an opaque session token and sends it in
the X-Session-Token header. These endpoints mint that token and let the website adopt it:

  POST /api/v1/session        mint a new anonymous session and return its token
  POST /api/v1/session/claim  turn a token into this browser's httpOnly cookie, so the website
                              shows the same checks as the extension

A session is anonymous: it holds no account, name, or contact detail. The token is a random
UUID, and holding it is what proves ownership of the session's assessments.
