"""Tests for the `source` and `capture_meta` fields of POST /api/v1/assess, and the category limit.

The extension tells the API where each submitted value came from (read from the page, edited by
the buyer, or not found) so the research export can describe how data was captured. That record
must stay safe to store, so these tests pin that:
  - `source` is one of two fixed values and defaults to "manual";
  - `capture_meta` accepts only a fixed set of keys and a fixed set of platform hosts, so a
    listing URL (or any other free text) can never be stored through it;
  - capture details are accepted only from the extension, and are size limited;
  - the admin records and CSV export show the source;
  - category is free text but length limited.
