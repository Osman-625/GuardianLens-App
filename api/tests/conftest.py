# Test setup shared by every API test: stub inference and in-memory storage, whatever the
# developer's own .env file says.
#
# The API reads its settings from the environment and from .env. A developer switches the local
# API to the trained models in .env, and loading them takes minutes, so tests that read that file
# would load the models every time they create the app. Environment variables take precedence over
# .env, so setting them here makes the tests behave the same on every machine. Tests that need
# other settings (for example the trained-model tests) build their own Settings explicitly or
# override these variables with monkeypatch, which wins over this fixture.
