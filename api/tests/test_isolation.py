# Pins that the API tests do not depend on the developer's own .env file.
#
# A developer switches the local API to trained models in .env (GUARDIANLENS_INFERENCE_MODE=trained
# and a model run folder). Loading those models takes minutes, so if the tests read that file, every
# test that creates the app would load them. The conftest in this folder forces stub inference for
# every test; this test fails if it stops doing so.
