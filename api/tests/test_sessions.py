"""Tests for the header-based session transport and the session claim endpoint.

The browser extension cannot share the website's cookie, so it identifies its buyer with an
opaque token sent in the X-Session-Token header. These tests pin:
  - minting a session, and using the token to own and read assessments;
  - an unknown token on submit is rejected with `session_invalid` (so the client can mint a
    new session and retry), while reading someone else's data stays a generic "not found";
  - the claim endpoint turns a token into the website's httpOnly cookie;
  - CORS allows the session header for the website;
  - a browser request from an origin the API does not serve is refused before it changes anything.

One TestClient is used per test on purpose: the app creates its in-memory repository when it
starts up, so two clients would not share sessions. Which "browser" is calling is simulated by
sending the header, or not.
