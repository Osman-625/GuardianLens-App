# First Draft Status

**Generated from:** `Pre_implementation docs.zip`

**Build classification:** Product and architecture first draft. Development-stub mode only.

## Completed and verified in the generation environment

| Area | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Archive inspection | All eight supplied Markdown files extracted and read | Copied unchanged to `docs/spec/` |
| FastAPI contract | Submission, status, result, cancel, feedback, history, development admin, and export routes created | `api/routers/` |
| Privacy controls | PII scrub, image re-encoding, raw inference text clearing, uploaded byte clearing after processing | `api/services/` |
| Ownership control | Cross-session result access returns a generic not-found response | Automated test |
| Missing-signal rule | No seller data becomes unknown, not suspicious | Automated test |
| Unsupported language rule | Chinese-dominant text returns a structured field error | Automated test |
| Python tests | 9 passed | `pytest -q` |
| Python syntax | Passed | `python -m compileall -q api ml scripts` |
| Secret scan | Passed | `python scripts/secret_scan.py` |
| Prose dash check | Passed | `python scripts/check_prose.py` |

## Created but not fully verified in the generation environment

| Area | State | Reason and required action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Next.js dependency graph | Exact direct versions are pinned in `frontend/package.json` | The sandbox could not resolve the npm registry. Run `npm install`, commit the generated lockfile, then run lint, type checking, and build. |
| Supabase migrations | Drafted from document 05 | No Supabase CLI or Postgres server was available. Apply to a disposable project and inspect policies before use. |
| Supabase adapter | Boundary exists but intentionally raises an error | Confirm P-2, then implement and integration-test it. |
| Admin authentication | Development token only | Replace with Supabase Auth and `profiles.role = 'admin'`. |
| Real model serving | Interfaces and bundle schema only | Train and archive the five required artefact groups, then build a real loader. |
| Latency evidence | Harness exists | Supply a real adapter. Stub output is marked invalid for NFR-02. |
| User-study materials | Drafts with blockers stated | Close O-3 and O-4, obtain supervisor approval, then finalise. |

## Integrity decisions

1. No marketplace scraper, crawler, URL fetcher, OCR pipeline, Facebook Marketplace support, community reporting, or guaranteed-fraud feature was added. A browser extension was added on 2026-10-05 after supervisor approval; it reads one listing only when the buyer clicks it (see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-extension-and-detail-site-design.md). The PRD and Chapter 3 documents in docs/spec still list the extension as out of scope and are updated in the documentation phase.
2. No research listing, label, adjudication, participant, consent, trial, or questionnaire row was generated.
3. No F1 score, calibration result, latency claim, user-study result, or risk-band threshold was presented as real evidence.
4. Development scores carry the bundle label `dev-stub-unvalidated` and a permanent warning.
5. Supabase remains the committed production database. The in-memory repository is restricted to stub development and automated tests.

## First implementation priority

Complete GL-P0-02 by installing frontend dependencies on a connected machine, generating the lockfile, and running the frontend checks. Then validate the SQL migrations in a disposable Supabase project and implement the real repository adapter before any real user or research data enters the application.
