// category, and it was trained on 12 categories. The product does NOT restrict buyers to
// those 12: any category text is accepted, and the model falls back to the overall average
// price for a category it has not seen. These helpers only (a) list the 12 as suggestions
// and (b) map a platform's own category wording onto one of them when the match is obvious.
